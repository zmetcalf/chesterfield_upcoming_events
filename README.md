Chesterfield Upcoming Events
============================

This WordPress plugin adds a custom meta field to pages, posts, and attachments
to enter a date for an upcoming event. These upcoming events are displayed
in a widget. It also has a custom post type, Events, that can put
future events in the widget when no details are present.

To get started, simply clone the repo in your plugins folder and activate
the plugin in WordPress admin.

To customize the Event template, create a file named single-chesterfield_event.php
